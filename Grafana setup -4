While Prometheus provides us with a web UI to view our metrics and craft charts, the web UI alone is often not the best solution to visualizing our data. Grafana is a robust visualization platform that will allow us to better see trends in our metrics and give us insight into what's going on with our applications and servers. It also lets us use multiple data sources, not just Prometheus, which gives us a full view of what's happening.
